<p>Pearson has made available the stories from the <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/apis/ft-press/#!/ftpress">Financial Times via an API</a> for over two years now, allowing developers to build applications around the financial and business news content.</p>
<p>According to Pearson, they have <em>"offered its <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/apis/ft-press/">FT Press API</a> for public use and exploration but it has become clear that its continued offering does not align to strategic goals of our new unified Pearson API platform.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>With this announcement Pearson has announced the <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/blog/sunset-for-the-ft-press-api/">deprecation of the public FTP Press API</a>&nbsp;which is part of <a href="https://developer.pearson.com/blog/creating-a-single-platform-for-all-pearson-apis/">larger rmigration at Pearson to a single API strategy across the entire company</a>, its products and partners.</p>
