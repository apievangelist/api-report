<p>The API Report is meant to provide an easy to read format, allowing anyone to quickly scan the daily API news, and if they want more detail they can visit linked websites for more information.</p>

<p>After four years of publishing API analysis on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, you start to get a feel for the format readers prefer, something I've adapted to be the API Report format:
    
<ul class="mainlist">
    <li>Informative, catchy title</li>
    <li>Simple opening paragraph</li>
    <li>Meet of the news in bullets or paragraph format</li>
    <li>Quick wrapup paragraph</li>
    <li>Single photo</li>
    <li>Link to more information</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is to provide a summary of the news, without adding much analysis or opinion, allowing readers to quicklky get up to speed and decide if they want to click, and receive more information.</p>

<p>While the editorial process is fairly open, we will be looking for posts that stick to this simple format, avoiding longer pieces that are over 500 words. We will provide feedback with any posts that are rejected, giving authors a change to better understand the format.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback, submit as issue, or fork the website and make the changes, and submit a pull request.</p>
